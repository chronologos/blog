Have I said anything that is avoidably ugly?”

Well I went storming into Bode’s office and said, How can anybody my age know as much as John Tukey does? He leaned back in his chair, put his hands behind his head, grinned slightly, and said, You would be surprised Hamming, how much you would know if you worked as hard as he did that many years. I simply slunk out of the office!

- A person who practices meditation becomes a finely tuned willpower machine.

- To get good at something often involves many small choices. Stopping oneself from a short distraction, spending a small pocket of time on practice etc. but it is these small choices that make good good.

- "Your entire life runs on the software (models) in your head. Why wouldn’t you obsess over optimizing it?" — Tim Urban
