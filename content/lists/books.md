[Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/41100566?shelf=read) has the latest books that I have read. Authors I deeply enjoy include David Foster Wallace[^1], William Faulkner and Yuval Noah Harari.

[^1]: I don't think I've read any other author with the ability to turn the banal into the sublime. His hyper-precise, stylized writing is also a joy to read.
