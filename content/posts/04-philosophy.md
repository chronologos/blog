I am a weak atheist, which means that I don't know if God exists but I'm inclined to be skeptical.


From Miessler's blog:
I take an absurdist approach to life, including the search for meaning and our lack of free will.

In short, there is no god, we don’t have free will, and there is no intrinsic meaning in the universe—but I see this as a starting point rather than an end. Rather than recoil from this, people should accept it honestly and rejoice in the potential beauty of human experience. In doing so we can create our own meaning structure based on shared conscious experience rather than fantasy.

In my opinion, morality is not about finding a pre-existing truth, but instead about discovering the best way to conduct ourselves in order to reduce suffering and increase happiness for conscious creatures (Russell, Harris).
